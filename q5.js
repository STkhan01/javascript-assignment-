
//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, 
//and include some whitespace characters at the beginning
// and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination,
// "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, 
//so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
//Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
